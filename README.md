# javaFactory
Library made to be easy to create models with test writing data. JavaFactory is inspired by [model-mommy](https://model-mommy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) mode of use. 

With a single line you can create an object with values(includind nested objects/collections/maps).

# How to use
You can use this lib for generate fake values, seeding a database, factory in tests, etc.

## Requirements

- Java 1.8+

## Install
**TODO**

## Hands on

The only thing you need is the class and type one single line:

```java
TempClass object = generator.make(TempClass.Class);
```

***TANDAM!*** you have a new instance of class and more important, with values!
